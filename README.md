Bank Marketing Campaign

We are going to use data from a marketing campaign implemented by a major banking institution. The outcome, y, is whether or not a bank salesperson was able to get a client to sign up for a term deposit (and is labeled 0 for no, and 1 for yes). The objective is to utilize classification algorithms to help the bank management and sales team understand how to maximize clients signing up for a term deposit. 
Missing values were replaced with unknown to understand impact of classification in logistic regression
Implemented prediction model with 90.7% accuracy and misclassification error with 9.47% to predict whether client will subscribe a term deposit (Y/N)
